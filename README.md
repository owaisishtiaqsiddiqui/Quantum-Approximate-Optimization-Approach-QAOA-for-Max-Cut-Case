# QAOA MaxCut Solver

...

The QAOA algorithm provides an approximate solution to the MaxCut problem. Here are some highlights from our results:

- **Graph**: The algorithm was tested on a graph with 4 nodes and 4 edges.
- **Exact Solution**: The exact solution was found using a classical eigensolver. The optimal cut had a value of X.
- **QAOA Solution**: The QAOA algorithm found a cut with a value of Y. This demonstrates that the QAOA algorithm can find near-optimal solutions to the MaxCut problem.

Here is a comparison of the exact and QAOA solutions:
